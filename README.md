## Trigonometric functions
**Trigonometric functions** is one of the basic Elementary function, which takes the angle (the most commonly used radian system in mathematics, the same below) as the independent variable, and the coordinate or ratio of the intersection point of the angle corresponding to the end edge of any angle and the Unit circle as the dependent variable. It can also be equivalently defined by the length of various line segments related to the Unit circle. Trigonometric functions plays an important role in studying the properties of geometric shapes such as triangles and circles, and is also a basic mathematical tool for studying periodic phenomena. In Mathematical analysis, Trigonometric functions is also defined as the solution of infinite series or specific differential equation, allowing their values to be extended to any real value, even complex value.

Common Trigonometric functions include sine function, cosine function and tangent function. Other Trigonometric functions such as cotangent function, secant function, cosecant function, vector function, cosector function, Haversine function, half cosector function will also be used in navigation, Topography, engineering and other disciplines. The relationship between different Trigonometric functions can be obtained through geometric intuition or calculation, which is called trigonometric identity.

Trigonometric functions is generally used to calculate the unknown length and angle of a triangle. In addition, Trigonometric functions can be used as a template to define a class of similar functions, called Hyperbolic functions. The common Hyperbolic functions is also called hyperbolic sine function, hyperbolic cosine function and so on. Trigonometric functions (also called circular function) is a function of angle; They are important in studying triangle and modeling periodic phenomena, as well as in many other applications. Trigonometric functions is usually defined as the ratio of two sides of a Right triangle containing this angle, or equivalent to the length of various line segments on the Unit circle. More modern definitions express them as infinite series or solutions to specific differential equations, allowing them to extend to any positive and negative numerical values, even complex values.

## 三角函数

**三角函数**是基本初等函数之一，是以角度（数学上最常用弧度制，下同）为自变量，角度对应任意角终边与单位圆交点坐标或其比值为因变量的函数。也可以等价地用与单位圆有关的各种线段的长度来定义。三角函数在研究三角形和圆等几何形状的性质时有重要作用，也是研究周期性现象的基础数学工具。在数学分析中，三角函数也被定义为无穷级数或特定微分方程的解，允许它们的取值扩展到任意实数值，甚至是复数值。

常见的三角函数包括正弦函数、余弦函数和正切函数。在航海学、测绘学、工程学等其他学科中，还会用到如余切函数、正割函数、余割函数、正矢函数、余矢函数、半正矢函数、半余矢函数等其他的三角函数。不同的三角函数之间的关系可以通过几何直观或者计算得出，称为三角恒等式。

三角函数一般用于计算三角形中未知长度的边和未知的角度，在导航、工程学以及物理学方面都有广泛的用途。另外，以三角函数为模版，可以定义一类相似的函数，叫做双曲函数。常见的双曲函数也被称为双曲正弦函数、双曲余弦函数等等。三角函数（也叫做圆函数）是角的函数；它们在研究三角形和建模周期现象和许多其他应用中是很重要的。三角函数通常定义为包含这个角的直角三角形的两个边的比率，也可以等价的定义为单位圆上的各种线段的长度。更现代的定义把它们表达为无穷级数或特定微分方程的解，允许它们扩展到任意正数和负数值，甚至是复数值。
